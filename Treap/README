main.cpp
    This is the main application source file. that is used for genrating the data.csv this program takes input test case file and retuen the data for analaysis of BST,AVL and Treap
treap.cpp 
    This is application for running only treap inserting node, searching element, print tree and delete tree

treap.h
    This is header file for treap it contain class and function definition and declaration of treap 

AVL.h
    This is header file for AVL it contain class snd function definition and declaration of AVL
BST.h
    This is header file for BST it contain class snd function definition and declaration of BST


data.csv 
	This file contain the output from main.cpp file it containt the number of rotation,comparision, number of nodes,  height of tree, test case file name, Tree type 

test_genrate.cpp 
    This cpp program used for creating five test case it asks number of operation and % of operation you want to as insert operation.
    it return five file 
        1. test0.txt
        2. test1.txt
        3. test2.txt
        4. test3.txt
        5. test4.txt
testX.txt
    X may be 0,1,2,3,4
    these file contain the insert and delete oprations 
    I have already created the test files if you want to create new test case then you can run the program 


How to run the Program :-
----------------------
1) Default Input file is already available and program works well without changing anything just compile and run the main.cpp program for comparison.
    
    Run on default tets files- 
        compile - g++ main.cpp -o main
        Run     - ./main

    if you want to create new tets file 
        compile - g++ test_genrate.cpp -o test
        compile - g++ main.cpp -o main
        Run ./test
        Run     - ./main

        


2) For treap demenstration you can run treap.cpp
    command- 
        compile - g++ treap.cpp -o treap
        Run     - ./treap
