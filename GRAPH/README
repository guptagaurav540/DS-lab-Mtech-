main.cpp
    This is the main application source file. that is used as a main program
    this program takes input Graph file
Graph.h 
    This is header file for Graph it contain class snd function definition
    and declaration of Graph
heap.h
    This is header file for min-heap implementation it contain class and 
    function definition and declaration of min-heap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to run the Program :-
----------------------
1) Default Input file is already available and program works well without
    changing anything just compile and run the main.cpp program for comparison.
    
    Run on default tets files- 
        compile - g++ main.cpp -o main
        Run     - ./main
    if you want to create new tets file 
        compile - g++ test_genrate.cpp -o test
    after the run program ask for Graph input file name
        test.txt or your test file name
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The main menu have diffrent choice you can choose the option 
    1.  DFS
        it aplly dfs on graph an by default create a dfs tree png image with name 
            "DFS_graph_image.png"
    
    2.  tarjan
        it find the SCC component ans print in console 
    
    3.  min-graph 
        it create the minimum graph and create a minimized image with name 
            "minimized_graph.png"
    
    4.  semi-connected
        it analyse the graph and print on console that - 
            graph is semiconnect (if graph is semi connected )
            graph is not semi connected (if graph is not semi connected)
    
    5.  Dijkstra algorithm 
            it ask start node input 
            it find the distance of vertices from the start node and create a table
                    | vertex distance |
    
    6.  print original graph    
            it create the png file of original graph which is we give as a input 
            with the name of
                "graph_image.png"
